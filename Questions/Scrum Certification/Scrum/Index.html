            <div class="QBox"> Upon what type of process control is Scrum based?</div>
            <div class="ABox"> Empirical</div>
            <div class="RBox"> Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known.</div>

        <div class="QABox">
            <div class="QBox"> What is the main reason for the Scrum Master to be at the Daily Scrum?</div>
            <div class="ABox"> He or she does not have to be there; he or she only has to ensure the Development Team has a Daily Scrum.</div>
            <div class="RBox"> The Scrum Master enforces the rule that only Development Team members participate in the Daily Scrum.</div>

            <div class="QBox"> True or False: When multiple teams work together on the same product, each team should maintain a separate Product Backlog.</div>
            <div class="ABox"> False</div>
            <div class="RBox"> Products have one Product Backlog, regardless of how many teams are used. Any other setup makes it difficult for the Development Team to determine what it should work on.</div>

        <div class="QABox">
            <div class="QBox"> Who is responsible for managing the progress of work during a Sprint?</div>
            <div class="ABox"> The Development Team</div>
            <div class="RBox"> The Development Team uses the Daily Scrum to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and to inspect how progress is trending toward completing the work in the Sprint Backlog.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="QABox">
            <div class="QBox"> The Product Backlog is ordered by:</div>
            <div class="ABox"> Whatever is deemed most appropriate by the Product Owner.</div>
            <div class="RBox"> The Product Owner decides what makes the most sense to optimize the value of the work being done by the Development Team.</div>

            <div class="QBox"> Which statement best describes Scrum?</div>
            <div class="ABox"> A framework within which complex products in complex environments are developed.</div>
            <div class="RBox"> Scrum is not a process or a technique for building products; rather, it is a framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques.</div>

        <div class="QABox">
            <div class="QBox"> When does a Development Team member become the sole owner of a Sprint Backlog item?</div>
            <div class="ABox"> Never. All Sprint Backlog Items are "owned" by the entire Development Team, even though each one may be implemented by an individual development team member.</div>
            <div class="RBox"> Sprint Backlog and all of its items are collectively owned by the Development Team. No individual team member can claim ownership over an item as this would block communication and collaboration.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="QABox">
            <div class="QBox"> Which of the following services are appropriate for a Scrum Master in regard to the Daily Scrum?</div>
            <div class="ABox"> Teach the Development Team to keep the Daily Scrum within the 15 minute time-box.</div>
            <div class="RBox"> The Scrum Master ensures that the Development Team has the meeting, but the Development Team is responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum. The Scrum Master teaches the Development Team to keep the Daily Scrum within the 15-minute time-box.
                The Scrum Master enforces the rule that only Development Team members participate in the Daily Scrum.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="QABox">
            <div class="QBox"> The CEO asks the Development Team to add a "very important" item to a Sprint that is in progress. What should the Development Team do?</div>
            <div class="ABox"> Inform the Product Owner so he/she can work with the CEO.</div>
            <div class="RBox"> The items selected for a Sprint have been selected as most valuable with the Product Owner. The items serve the Sprint's goal. No changes should be made that endanger the Sprint Goal. No one external to the Scrum Team can force changes on
                the Development Team (Sprint Backlog) and the Product Owner (Product Backlog).</div>
        </div>
        <div class="QABox">
            <div class="QBox"> Why is the Daily Scrum held at the same time and same place?</div>
            <div class="ABox"> The consistency reduces complexity.</div>
            <div class="RBox"> The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity.</div>

        <div class="QABox">
            <div class="QBox"> The length of a Sprint should be:</div>
            <div class="ABox"> Short enough to keep the business risk acceptable to the Product Owner.</div>
            <div class="ABox"> Short enough to be able to synchronize the development work with other business events.</div>
            <div class="ABox"> No more than one month.</div>
            <div class="RBox"> All of these choices are appropriate considerations in determining the length of a Sprint.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="QABox">
            <div class="QBox"> Which statement best describes a Product Owner's responsibility?</div>
            <div class="ABox"> Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team does.</div>
            <div class="RBox"> The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Development Team.

        <div class="QABox">
            <div class="QBox"> Who creates the definition of Done?</div>
            <div class="ABox"> The development organization (or Development Team if none is available from the development organization)</div>
            <div class="RBox"> If the definition of "done" is part of the conventions, standards or guidelines of the development organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. The Development Team of the Scrum Team can complement it with elements specific for
                the product or context. If "done" for an increment is not a convention of the development organization, the Development Team of the Scrum Team must define a definition of "done" appropriate for the product.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="QABox">
            <div class="QBox"> Development Team membership should change:</div>
            <div class="ABox"> As needed, while taking into account a short term reduction in productivity.</div>
            <div class="RBox"> Teams typically go through some steps before achieving a state of increased performance. Changing membership typically reduces cohesion, affecting performance and productivity in the short term.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="QABox">
            <div class="QBox"> True or False: The Scrum Team should choose at least one high priority process improvement, identified during the Sprint Retrospective, and place it in the Product Backlog.</div>
            <div class="ABox"> False</div>
            <div class="RBox"> False, to ensure continuous improvement, the Sprint Backlog rather than the Product Backlog includes at least one high priority process improvement identified in the previous Sprint Retrospective meeting.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="QABox">
            <div class="QBox"> What is the role of Management in Scrum?</div>
            <div class="ABox"> Support the Product Owner with insights and information into high value product and system capabilities. Support the Scrum Master to cause organizational change that fosters empiricism, self-organization, bottom-up intelligence, and intelligent
                release of software.</div>
            <div class="RBox"> Management has no active role in the actual product development through Scrum. However, management external to the Scrum team is incredibly important in setting the vision and strategy to guide the overall direction of the organization.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="QABox">
            <div class="QBox"> When might a Sprint be abnormally cancelled?</div>
            <div class="ABox"> When the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete.</div>
            <div class="RBox"> A Sprint can be cancelled before the Sprint time-box is over. A Sprint would be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. This might occur if the company changes direction or if market or technology conditions change.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="QABox">
            <div class="QBox"> Which of the below are roles on a Scrum Team?</div>
            <div class="ABox"> Product Owner</div>
            <div class="ABox"> Scrum Master</div>
            <div class="ABox"> Development Team</div>
            <div class="RBox"> The Scrum Team consists of a Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="QABox">
            <div class="QBox"> Who is required to attend the Daily Scrum?</div>
            <div class="ABox"> The Development Team.</div>
            <div class="RBox"> Only the people doing the work described on the Sprint Backlog need to inspect and adapt at the Daily Scrum. If the Scrum Master or Product Owner is also on the Development Team, they will need to be at the Daily Scrum. Otherwise, the Scrum
                Master simply has to make sure the Development Team knows how to conduct a Daily Scrum and does so.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="QABox">
            <div class="QBox"> What are the two primary ways a Scrum Master keeps a Development Team working at its highest level of productivity?</div>
            <div class="ABox"> By facilitating Development Team decisions</div>
            <div class="ABox"> By removing impediments that hinder the Development Team</div>
            <div class="RBox"> A Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Development Team. Facilitation and removing impediments serves a team in achieving the best productivity possible.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="QABox">
            <div class="QBox"> The Development Team should not be interrupted during the Sprint. The Sprint Goal should remain intact. These are conditions that foster creativity, quality and productivity.</div>
            <div class="ABox"> The Sprint Backlog is fully formulated in the Sprint Planning meeting and does not change during the Sprint.</div>
            <div class="RBox"> The Sprint Backlog makes visible all of the work that the Development Team identifies as necessary to meet the Sprint Goal. The Development Team modifies the Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and the Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint.</div>

            <div class="ABox"> The Scrum Master</div>
            <div class="RBox"> The Scrum Team consists of the Scrum Master (manages the process), the Product Owner (decides what to do) and the Development Team (does the work).</div>
        </div>
        <div class="QABox">
            <div class="QBox"> True or False: The purpose of a Sprint is to produce a done increment of working product.</div>
            <div class="ABox"> True</div>
            <div class="RBox"> The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a "Done", usable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="QABox">
            <div class="QBox"> True or False: It is mandatory that the product increment be released to production at the end of each Sprint.</div>
            <div class="ABox"> False</div>
            <div class="RBox"> The product increment should be usable and releasable at the end of every Sprint, but it does not have to be released.

            <div class="QBox"> Which three behaviors demonstrate that a team is NOT self-organizing and are NOT following the Scrum Guide?</div>
            <div class="ABox"> Stakeholders attend the Daily Scrum to check progress and work with the Scrum Master to optimize the functional scope for the Sprint.</div>
            <div class="ABox"> The Development Team members are working within the boundaries of their functional description and nicely handing off work from analyst to developer to tester to integration.</div>
            <div class="ABox"> The Development Team invites external people to the Sprint Planning to ask them how to turn a Product Backlog item into an Increment via a complete and detailed Sprint Backlog.</div>
            <div class="RBox"> The Daily Scrum is for the Development Team and attended by the Development Team. It should not be used by external stakeholders to check progress.</div>
            <div class="RBox"> During Sprint Planning the Scrum Team should be crafting the Sprint Goal based on the set of Product Backlog items selected for the sprint. The Development Team identifies the necessary work to meet the Sprint Goal.</div>
            <div class="RBox"> Scrum Development Team members don’t have titles, and no sub-teams; such as, testing, architecture, or operations are recognized. Accountability belongs with the Development Team as a whole, regardless of whether team members have specialized
                skills.

        <div class="QABox">
            <div class="QBox"> An organization has decided to adopt Scrum, but management wants to change the terminology to fit with terminology already used. What will likely happen if this is done?</div>
            <div class="ABox"> Without a new vocabulary as a reminder of the change, very little change may actually happen.</div>
            <div class="ABox"> The organization may not understand what has changed with Scrum and the benefits of Scrum may be lost.</div>
            <div class="ABox"> Management may feel less anxious.</div>

            <div class="RBox"> Optimal Development Team size is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work. Fewer than three Development Team members decreases interaction and results in smaller productivity gains. More than nine members
